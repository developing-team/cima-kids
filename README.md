## What is this project?
It is a third project in Orange Coding Academy about some random website for kids movies called "Cima Kids" which includes different pages "Home, Catalogue, SignUp/LogIn, About Us, Contact Us".

## What did we use to create Cima Kids?
We created some unique styles for Cima Kids by using HTML, CSS, JS, then we created our own Database by using Firebase and which includes different details about the movies and users on the website, then we got these details by using API concepts to deliver the data to the site, and finally, we make sure to be the website easy to use even for kids.
